Ways of Seeing 

I selected the first chapter of Ways of Seeing, laid out all the text across the canvas, and animated the words related to "see" to make them blink like an eye.

Question: With in the draw function:
//Why can't we omit it here even though it was defined it globally earlier?
  let mString = mStrings[0];
  let mWords = mString.toLowerCase().split(" ");
